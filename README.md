# Overview

gogadget is a toolkit for producing immersion and priming materials for language learning.

- It tries to solve the problem that many of the most powerful tools available are hard to install, difficult to use or are paywalled.
- It is capable of downloading audio and video files, automatically transcribing subtitles from videos and podcasts, and automatically producing filtered Anki decks with sentence audio / translations / screenshots / definitions.

## Key Features

- Simple, well documented interface that is consistent across each of its tools.
- Download video, audio and subtitle files.
- Automatic generation of subtitles from video and audio files.
- Produce filtered Anki decks from subtitles that:
  - Contain images and sentence audio from the source video / audio files.
  - Automatically filter out common and known words to reduce Anki review load.
  - Prioritises words that are the most frequent in the source media.
  - Include automatic translations of sentences and definitions of words.
  - Can be built for an individual episode or a whole season.
- Create word frequency analyses for priming purposes.
- One click installer for Windows and simple installation steps for macOS and Linux.
- Ability to save defaults so that commands can be kept as short and memorable as possible.
- It supports 19 languages fully with partial support for many more.
- Once you have installed the resources for your language, all modules apart from `gogadget download` are fully offline. This makes it useful for travelling or processing personal conversations as there is no server involved.

## General Examples

Please see the [Youtube Tutorial](#youtube-tutorial) for demonstrations of the features, including configuration for more advanced users.

1. Download a video:

   ```sh
   gogadget download --url "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid"
   ```

2. Automatically create subtitles for a video / folder of videos that are in English (`en`):

   ```sh
   gogadget transcribe --input-path "your folder or filename" --language en
   ```

3. Generate Anki cards from a full season of an Italian (`it`) program. Include images / audio on the cards, translate the sentences to the default language (English) and exclude the 1000 most common Italian words:

   ```sh
   gogadget anki-deck --input-directory "folder name" --language it --excluded-words "ita_top_1000_words.xlsx"
   ```

4. You can set default parameters using `gogadget set-defaults --custom`. Once you have set up your defaults, this would allow you to type the following for example (3):

   ```sh
   gogadget anki-deck --input-directory "folder name"
   ```

5. Commands have both a "standard" form and a "short" form. You can use whatever works best for you! The following two lines are equivalent:

   ```sh
   gogadget download --url "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid" --output-directory "immersion videos" --subtitle_language en
   gogadget download -i "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid" -o "immersion videos" -l en
   ```

All commands will produce help text by default, eliminating the need to remember syntax. For example:

## Worked Example

Go to [Example use case](#example-use-case) which shows an example use case that includes downloading a playlist, transcribing subtitles and creating a fully featured Anki deck. It also shows how setting defaults can reduce the process to three simple commands.

## Custom Installation Notes

You should ignore this section if you are using the installation instructions for Windows, macOS or Linux. This is only to help anyone doing their own custom installation.

Notes on Python version:

- The tool is currently compatible with Python `3.10`, `3.11` and `3.12`.
- `3.13` is **not** supported as the dependencies `ctranslate2` and `torch` do not currently provide compatible packages.
- If you manually install gogadget and you get errors about either of these packages, a Python version issue is probably the cause.

# Quick Start

This is a written overview on how to use the tool. If this isn't your thing, you might find the following useful instead:

- **If you prefer to watch a tutorial rather than follow written instructions, it is available here: [Youtube Tutorial](#youtube-tutorial)**
- Examples of some of the functions are given here: [General Examples](#general-examples)
- Full written documentation of every function in the tool is available here: [Command reference](#command-reference)
- An explanation of the settings file is here: [Default Parameters](#default-parameters)

## Understanding Commands

The intended behaviour is that the tool itself will guide the user on how to use it. If you type `gogadget` in a command prompt or terminal window, you will get:

![Main menu](https://github.com/jonathanfox5/gogadget/raw/main/examples/readme_images/main_menu.png?raw=true)

All commands are listed in the `Primary Functions` box and have their own documentation. Each command has parameters associated with it. These can be listed by just typing `gogadget` then the name of the command that you are interested in. For example, `gogadget download` produces:

![Download Help Text](https://github.com/jonathanfox5/gogadget/raw/main/examples/readme_images/download_help.png?raw=true)

You will see from the output of that command that you can just run the following to download a video:

```sh
gogadget download --url "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid"
```

Several commands use a standardised two letter code to identify languages (e.g. English is `en`, Italian is `it`, Japanese is `ja`, etc.) To get a list of supported languages and the associated two letter codes, run this command:

```sh
gogadget list-languages
```

## _[Advanced]_ Short Names

All parameters in all commands have both a "standard" form and a "short" form. You can use whatever works best for you! The following two lines are equivalent.

```sh
gogadget download --url "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid" --output-directory "immersion videos" --subtitle_language en
gogadget download -i "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid" -o "immersion videos" -l en
```

Note: Regardless of the "standard" name, all commands follow the same logic for their "short" names. The item that is being used as input is `-i`, the output is `-o` and the language is `-l`. Normally you don't need any more than this!

## Configuration

It's recommended, but not required, that you fully install the models for the languages that you are interested in. e.g. To install Italian (target language) with English (native language) translations, run:

```sh
gogadget install --language it --translation-language en
```

You can also configure defaults so that you don't need to specify as many parameters each time you run your commands:

```sh
gogadget set-defaults --custom
```

## Getting dictionary, word audio and exclude lists

`gogadget anki-deck` accepts the following arguments:

- `--dictionary` This should be a dictionary in json format. [Vocabsieve's documentation](https://docs.freelanguagetools.org/resources.html) is an excellent resource for finding one in your target language. I personally use the Migaku `Vicon_Ita_to_Eng_Dictionary.json` that is linked in the Vocabsieve docs and the Wiktionary ones are also very good.
- `--word-audio` This is should be a directory of `mp3` files with native pronunciations of individual words. [Vocabsieve's documentation](https://docs.freelanguagetools.org/resources.html) is, again, an excellent resource for these. I use both the Forvo and Lingua Libre ones that are linked in the Vocabsieve docs. The use of `mp3` (rather than any other audio format) is enforced by the tool due to compatibility issues with certain versions of Anki. If you are on macOS or Linux then you can use FFMPEG to batch convert from `ogg` to `mp3`.

  ```sh
   for i in *.ogg; do ffmpeg -i "$i" "${i%.*}.mp3"; done
   rm *.ogg
  ```

- `--excluded-words` is a spreadsheet with words that you don't want included in your deck. This is useful to make sure that you aren't wasting time reviewing words that you already know. [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists) is a good source for frequency lists but you could also export your known words from Anki to get a more personalised experience. The only requirement is that the words that you want to filter out should be in column `A` of the spreadsheet though you can use multiple sub-sheets in the file if you wish to organise them.

## Example use case

The following example is my personal use case for producing priming materials prior to immersing in them. My target language is Italian (`it`) and my native language is English(`en`). I have set up a json dictionary, word audio and an exclude list as described in [Getting dictionary, word audio and exclude lists](#getting-dictionary-word-audio-and-exclude-lists).

As a "one off" task, I set up my default settings by running `gogadget set-defaults --custom`. I changed the following settings from the defaults. [the defaults are set for the widest compatibility, not for a specific workflow]

```ini
[general]
# Change language to target language (mine is Italian)
language = it
language_for_translations = en
output_directory = .

[external_resources]
# Set the paths of the resources on my hard drive
dictionary_file = /Users/jonathan/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Italian/Dictionaries/Dictionaries/Migaku/Vicon_Ita_to_Eng_Dictionary.json
word_audio_directory = /Users/jonathan/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Italian/Dictionaries/Audio
word_exclude_spreadsheet = /Users/jonathan/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Italian/Dictionaries/Frequency_lists/ita_exclude.xlsx

[anki]
# Change the `include_words_with_no_definition` to False. By filtering out words not in the dictionary, this has the effect of filtering out proper nouns and non-target language words
extract_media = True
include_words_with_no_definition = False
subs_offset_ms = 0
subs_buffer_ms = 50
max_cards_in_deck = 100

[lemmatiser]
# Keep the settings in here as default but might be useful to tweak them for other languages
lemmatise = True
filter_out_non_alpha = True
filter_out_stop_words = True
convert_input_to_lower = True
convert_output_to_lower = True
return_just_first_word_of_lemma = True

[downloader]
# I keep subtitle_language blank as I prefer to generate my own using `gogadget transcribe`
advanced_options =
format =
subtitle_language =

[transcriber]
# Change `whisper_use_gpu` to True on my windows PC which has an Nvidia GPU. This massively speeds up transcription but isn't compatible unless you have a GPU that can run CUDA
whisper_model = deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2
alignment_model =
subtitle_format = vtt
whisper_use_gpu = True
```

Now that these parameters are set, they no longer need to be specified in the commands.

For this example, let's assume that I'm downloading a playlist of videos for a specific series that I want to learn the key vocabulary for. The URL of this hypothetical playlist is `https://www.videosite.com/playlist_name` and I'm storing everything in a folder called `immersion`.

I would take the following steps. You can type the command without the extra parameters into your terminal (e.g. `gogadget download`) if you want to understand the specific options that I'm choosing.

1. Download the videos that are in the playlist:

   ```sh
   gogadget download -i "https://www.videosite.com/playlist_name" -o "immersion"
   ```

2. Transcribe the Italian subtitles for all of the videos in the folder. I could have just downloaded them in the previous step by specifying a `--subtitle-language` in the command or in the defaults but I prefer the accuracy of transcribing them myself.

   ```sh
   gogadget transcribe -i "immersion" -o "immersion"
   ```

3. Create the Anki deck:

   ```sh
   gogadget anki-deck -i "immersion"
   ```

An Anki deck will be written to `immersion/media/`. I can then just double click on the `.apkg` file in there and it will automatically be loaded.

## `gogadget anki-deck`

Build an Anki deck using the most common vocabulary in a subtitles file or a folder of subtitles. Optionally include audio and / or screenshots from the source media file(s).

If you use this regularly, it's highly recommended to set the default paths to your dictionary, excluded words, etc. and preferred processing options to simplify the process.
You can set your defaults using the following command:

```sh
gogadget set-defaults --custom
```

**Examples**:

1. Normal usage using standard names where your target language is italian and your native language is English.

   ```sh
   gogadget anki-deck --input-directory "folder containing subtitles and media files" --language it --translation-language en
   ```

2. As per (1) but uses dictionary, word exclude list and word audio bank. Also uses --exclude-no-definition to filter out proper nouns / non-target language words.

   ```sh
   gogadget anki-deck --input-directory "folder containing subtitles and media files" --language it --translation-language en --dictionary "dictionary.json" --word_audio "folder_name" --excluded-words "excel_name.xlsx" --exclude-no-definition
   ```

3. Equivalent of (2) using short names.

   ```sh
   gogadget anki-deck -i "folder containing subtitles and media files" -l it -t en -d "dictionary.json" -w "folder_name" -e "excel_name.xlsx" -h
   ```

4. If you have set all of your defaults as described above, you can just run.

   ```sh
   gogadget anki-deck -i "folder containing subtitles and media files"
   ```

**Usage**:

```console
$ gogadget anki-deck [OPTIONS]
```

**Options**:

- `-i, --input-directory PATH`: Directory (folder) containing the video file(s) and subtitle files(s) to be turned into an Anki deck.
- `-l, --language TEXT`: Language to use for processing. This should be a two letter language code, e.g. `en` (for English), `es` (for Spanish) or `it` (Italian). Run `gogadget list-languages` for a list of supported languages.
- `-t, --translation-language TEXT`: [Optional] Language to use for translations. Translation quality is generally best if either the target language or the translation is set to `en` (English). This should be a two letter language code, e.g. `en` (for English), `es` (for Spanish) or `it` (Italian). Run `gogadget list-languages` for a list of supported languages.
- `-f, --offset INTEGER`: [Optional] Time, in milliseconds, to offset the subtitles by when extracting audio. Not normally required if subtitles were generated by gogadget transcribe.
- `-b, --buffer INTEGER`: [Optional] Extra time, in milliseconds, to add to the extracted audio to avoid it being cut off. Not normally required if subtitles were generated by gogadget transcribe.
- `-x, --max-cards INTEGER`: [Optional] Maximum number of cards to include in the deck.
- `-w, --word-audio PATH`: [Optional] Directory of mp3 files of individual words to include in the Anki cards.
- `-d, --dictionary PATH`: [Optional] Dictionary in json format to retrieve definitions from for the Anki cards.
- `-e, --excluded-words PATH`: [Optional] Spreadsheet containing words to exclude from the analysis (e.g. the most common words in a language, words already learned). Words should be in the first column of the spreadsheet but can be split across multiple sub-sheets within the file.
- `-m, --lemma / -n, --no-lemma`: [Optional] Enable or disable lemmatisation. If supported for your language, this is generally recommended.
- `-s, --stop-words / -p, --no-stop-words`: [Optional] If lemmatisation is enabled, you can include or exclude stop words. Stop words are short 'function' words such as 'the', 'that', 'which', etc.
- `-q, --media / -r, --no-media`: [Optional] Media to extract sentence audio and screenshots from to display on the Anki card. This can either be a video or audio only source.
- `-g, --include-no-definition / -h, --exclude-no-definition`: [Optional] Include cards where the definition can't be found in the dictionary. Setting `--exclude-no-definition` may improve the quality of the deck as it will likely filter many proper nouns, words not from the target language, etc.
- `--help`: Show this message and exit.

## `gogadget transcribe`

Produce subtitle file(s) from audio or video using whisperX.

`--input_path` and `-i` accept both files and directories of files.

If you have an NVIDIA GPU that is set up for CUDA, it's strongly recommended to pass the `--gpu` flag as this significantly speeds up the tool.

You can also reduce runtime (at the expense of accuracy) by specifying `--whisper-model small`

**Examples**:

   ```sh
   gogadget transcribe -i "path to media file or folder containing media files" -o "folder to save to" -l en -g
   ```

**Usage**:

```console
$ gogadget transcribe [OPTIONS]
```

**Options**:

- `-i, --input-path PATH`: Path to the video or audio file to transcribe. This can be either a specific video / audio file or a folder of files.
- `-l, --language TEXT`: Language to use for processing. This should be a two letter language code, e.g. `en` (for English), `es` (for Spanish) or `it` (Italian). Run `gogadget list-languages` for a list of supported languages.

# Default Parameters

```ini
[instructions]
# Main instruction:
# - Set your default values in this file
#
# Some tips:
# - Everything in here is treated as a string.
#   Therefore, do ~~~NOT~~~ include 'quote marks' around any of your entries, it will just break things!
# - You can type True or False for settings that are on/off (e.g. lemmatise, extract_media, etc.)
# - The script will attempt to fall back to sensible defaults if it can't read your values.
#   If your setting appears to not be read by the tool, this is probably the reason!
# - When specifying values in [external_resources], you can type None to show that the functionality is being used.
#   This does not work in any other section.
#   (Reasoning: This behaviour simplifies the user interface for less experienced users.
#   If you are reading this, you are being treated as an 'advanced user'!)
#
# ~~~~ WARNING ~~~~ It is possible to break the tool by setting incorrect values in here
#   Run `gogadget set-defaults --factory` (without quotes) to reset this file if you run into errors or unexplained behaviour

# Developer

## Running from source

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is used to build the packages, the installers use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run the tool in its own virtual environment and the only non-Python dependency is [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org).

To download and run the code from source, run the following commands:

```sh
# Download the repo and enter it
git clone https://github.com/jonathanfox5/gogadget
cd gogadget

# Create the virtual environment and install packages
poetry install

# Enter the virtual environment
poetry shell

# Run the tool
gogadget
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Some basic requirements:

- All code should be linted / formatted using [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/). The `pyproject.toml` file in the repository contains project specific settings that should be automatically picked up by both the command line version and VSCode extension versions of ruff. The main requirements are 100 line length, 4 spaces as intent, import linting and double quotes.
- All code should be type checked by [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org). Support for `import-untyped` checking is disabled in `pyproject.toml` to avoid the need to generate stubs for third party libraries.
