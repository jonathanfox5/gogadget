## Overview

`gogadget` is a toolkit for producing immersion and priming materials for language learning.

- It tries to solve the problem that many of the most powerful tools available are hard to install, difficult to use or require lots of effort to configure for optimal results.
- It is capable of downloading audio and video files, automatically transcribing subtitles from videos and podcasts, and automatically producing filtered Anki decks with sentence audio / translations / screenshots / definitions.

## Key features

- Simple, well documented interface that is consistent across each of its tools.
- Download video, audio and subtitle files.
- Automatic generation of subtitles from video and audio files.
- Produce filtered Anki decks from subtitles that:
  - Contain images and sentence audio from the source video / audio files.
  - Automatically filter out common and known words to reduce Anki review load.
  - Prioritises words that are the most frequent in the source media.
  - Include automatic translations of sentences and definitions of words.
  - Can be built for an individual episode or a whole season.
- Create word frequency analyses for priming purposes.
- [One click installer](https://github.com/jonathanfox5/gogadget/releases/) for Windows and [simple installation steps](getting_started/installation.md) for macOS and Linux.
- Ability to save defaults so that commands can be kept as short and memorable as possible.
- It supports 19 [languages](getting_started/supported_languages.md) fully with partial support for many more.
- Once you have installed the resources for your language, all modules apart from `gogadget download` are fully offline. This makes it useful for travelling or for processing personal conversations as there is no server involved.
