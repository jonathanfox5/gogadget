Gogadget is a toolkit for producing immersion and priming materials for language learning.

- It tries to solve the problem that many of the most powerful tools available are hard to install, difficult to use or require lots of effort to configure for optimal results.
- It is capable of downloading audio and video files, automatically transcribing subtitles from videos and podcasts, and automatically producing filtered Anki decks with sentence audio / translations / screenshots / definitions.
